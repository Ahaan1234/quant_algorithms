# Quant Algorithms Playground

This repository will house experiments for building and evaluating quantitative trading algorithms. Use it as a sandbox to prototype strategies, backtest ideas, and compare performance across approaches. Initial goals:

Future additions may include example notebooks, reusable testing harnesses, and documentation for running simulations against different datasets.
